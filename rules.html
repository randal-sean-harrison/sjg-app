                           Unlike <em>Monopoly</em>, which assumes a level socioeconomic playing field, The Social
                           Justice
                           Game (SJG) more closely reflects actual inequities under the current American economy. By
                           effecting real-world economic disparities at the start of the game, SJG aims to stimulate a
                           frustration so comically absurd that gameplay evolves into a discussion among the players
                           around
                           the
                           systemic inequities of contemporary capitalism.

                        <p>
                           The primary goal for each player is to avoid bankruptcy—to survive and thrive, earning enough
                           money to comfortably navigate the costs, penalties, and unexpected twists of fate which
                           arise.
                           <em>The surest way to do that is to purchase properties which produce rent from other
                              players.</em> While Unemployed and Employees will find it difficult to purchase properties

                           are able to take loans. They may also rise socioeconomically through joining the military or
                           attending college.

                        <p>Every rule in SJG exists through the democratic agreement of the players. Players may loan

                           other money, form specific agreements, and even create new rules. If any player whose turn it
                           is
                           wishes to add, eliminate or change a rule, that player may forfeit their turn to propose a
                           rule
                           and call a vote. With a simple majority affirming it, the game rule is adopted.</p>

                        <p>A proposed rule should pertain to all players, and not simply the person making the rule.
                           Consider the following rule proposed by an Unemployed player:</p>

                        <p class="alert alert-danger">
                           <strong><i class="fad fa-frown-open mr-2"></i>BAD</strong><br />

                        </p>

                        <p>This rule seems vague &mdash; what is a "rich" player? It’s not a valid rule, nor is likely
                           to
                           win the simple majority of votes to pass. If the player wants to fight the economic injustice
                           she feels, she might try:</p>

                        <p class="alert alert-success">
                           <strong><i class="fad fa-laugh mr-2"></i>BETTER</strong><br />
                           I propose that Owners &mdash; whose earning potential is disproportionately larger than
                           unemployed and employees &mdash; subsidize non-owner payments for Flint Water and Enron
                           Electric, charging us only $20 each for Flint Water and Enron Electric each payday.
                        </p>

                        <p>This rule proposal is likely to be more successful because it offers a persuasive rationale
                           and
                           because it reduces the value of the Owner’s utilities, rather than removing their value
                           entirely. This rule would benefit Managers directly, and a Manager might support such a rule.
